To improve the readability and compactness of your multi-page timesheet reports for each client, especially when some clients have over 10 pages per month, here are practical strategies you can implement:

✅ 1. Summarize with Subtotals
Group by project or task (if not already) — but:

Show daily entries only when needed (e.g., for billable audits).

Else, collapse to weekly/project summary.

✅ Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Project: LMS Redesign
  Week 1: 12.5h
  Week 2: 9.25h
  Week 3: 11.0h
  Week 4: 13.75h
  → Total: 46.5h
✅ 2. Use Weekly Summaries Instead of Daily Entries
Instead of showing each day, show weekly totals per project.

✅ Example Table:

Week	Project	Total Hours	Notes
Jul 1–7	LMS Redesign	12.5	Feature X, Testing
Jul 1–7	Website Revamp	8.0	Landing page, SEO
Jul 8–14	LMS Redesign	9.0	Bug Fixes, Planning

✅ 3. Avoid Repeating Headers
Make sure you only repeat section headers when necessary (e.g., on a new page), to save space.

✅ 4. Consolidate Columns
Only show columns that are necessary for the client.

Replace:

| Date | Start | End | Duration | Project | Task | Notes |

With something cleaner:

| Week | Project | Task Summary | Total Hrs |

✅ 5. Client-Facing Notes Only
If notes are detailed, trim internal details — only include client-relevant task summaries.

✅ 6. PDF Formatting Tips
Use landscape orientation for wider tables.

Reduce page margins if possible.

Use smaller but readable font (10–11px).

Fit 2 columns per page if clients have multiple projects.

✅ 7. Optional: Append Raw Data Separately
Have:

Summary section first (2–3 pages max)

Raw entries or detailed breakdown as appendix
